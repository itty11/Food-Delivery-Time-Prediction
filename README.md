# Food-Delivery-Time-Prediction
This project builds a machine learning model to predict the delivery time (in minutes) for food orders based on real-world delivery data. It includes distance computation using the Haversine formula, K-Means clustering for regional segmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and a Streamlit web app for interactive prediction.
